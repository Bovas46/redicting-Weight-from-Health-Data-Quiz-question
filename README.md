# redicting-Weight-from-Health-Data-Quiz-question

In this project, I worked on predicting weight using a Linear Regression model. First, I loaded the dataset and explored it to understand the features available. Since the dataset didnâ€™t include exercise level, I simulated this data to add a lifestyle factor.

Next, I prepared the data by encoding the exercise level and splitting it into training and test sets. I trained the Linear Regression model on the training data to learn the relationship between age, height, exercise level, and weight.

After training, I evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error to measure its accuracy and created a plot comparing actual and predicted weights to visualize performance.

This process taught me the importance of good data and how simple models can provide useful insights, though real-world accuracy depends on having detailed and reliable features.
